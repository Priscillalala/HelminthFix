# Helminth Hatchery Fix

The priority of the Helminth Hatchery post-processing is set too low and fails to override some important settings. As a result, the stage is very dark. I am unsure if this is a bug or intentional (it has not been addressed in a patch yet), but this mod fixes the post-processing priority.

*Thank you to qwp for bringing this to my attention*
